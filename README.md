# Keep The Rain

A Minecraft mod for the Fabric mod loader which makes rain stay after sleeping.

Rain often doesn't last long if you sleep regularly. If you like rain and don't want it to clear after sleeping, this mod is for you. It adds a gamerule to enable clearing weather after sleeping, which is off by default.
